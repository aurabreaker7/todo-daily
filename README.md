## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript — a single file, zero frameworks, zero build step
- **Backend:** A FastAPI + Supabase REST API (deployed separately), talked to via a lightweight fetch-based client built into the page
- **Hosting:** [Railway](https://railway.app/)

## 📂 Project Structure

```
📁 taskboard/
└── 📄 index.html   # The entire web app — auth, task board, timer, graphs, insights, leaderboard, profile
```

Yes, really — one file. No `npm install`, no bundler, no build pipeline.

---

## 🚀 Running Locally

Since it's a static single-file app, any static file server works:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser. 🎉

---

## 🔌 Backend Requirement

This frontend expects a compatible backend API URL, set via:

```js
window.TASKBOARD_API_URL = "https://your-backend-url.com";
```

Without a live backend, login and data syncing won't work — but you can still browse the UI locally.
